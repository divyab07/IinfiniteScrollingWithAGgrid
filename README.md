# AG Grid Infinite Scrolling with Loading...

This project implements infinite scrolling in AG Grid with a custom loading... for large datasets, providing a seamless user experience when fetching data from an API. The project uses React, AG Grid, and Axios to implement dynamic data loading and display.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling:** Dynamically fetches and displays data as the user scrolls, reducing the need to load the entire dataset at once.
- **Custom Loader:** Shows a loading  while fetching rows from the API to provide visual feedback to users.
- **API Integration:** Fetches data from a public API with pagination, simulating large datasets.
- **Responsive UI:** Uses AG Grid's responsive layout to ensure the table works well across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For the frontend UI and component-based architecture.
- **AG Grid:** For displaying data with infinite scrolling capabilities.
- **Axios:** For making API requests and handling data fetching.
- **CSS:** For custom styles and the loading effect.
